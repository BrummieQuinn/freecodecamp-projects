# <ins>Freecodecamp project - survey form.</ins>

This was my first attempt at building a project, period.

## ***My thoughts.*** :thought_balloon:

### <ins>The structural layoutâ€¦</ins>

The HTML itself wasn't a problem, creating the form with the correct element tags wasn't too difficult.

However, I misunderstood the principle of semantic HTML to mean that no divs or spans could be used or at least sparingly if they were.

Obviously, this is not the case, as I came to realise upon styling the form.
Divs and spans can be added after the semantic HTML has been placed or during, to create containers around the elements to aid with targeted CSS styling of elements.

Most of my time was spent making sure the html was semantic.

### <ins>Stylingâ€¦</ins>

Caveat, CSS styling isn't my strong suit I feel.
So many choices, so little time ðŸ˜Š.

While given an example to give ideas, I decided I didn't want it to be completely exact in feel

I decided to focus on accessibility above all with my design choices as getting user information is the most important part of a form.

I chose subtle colours in a linear gradient to be easy on the eyes.

I also added a transition on the submit button, I thought it was kind of fun for the word submit to show up more clearly on hover.

On reflection, while fun, may not have been the best choice when I was focusing on accessibility.

### <ins>Final thoughtsâ€¦</ins>:thought_balloon:

I plan to keep going back to this web form to improve the CSS as I learn more.

For example,  I was given feedback from my mentor, on the button and the colour of the text in the header (accessibility) and I was also advised on how to neaten my html which I have already done and shorten my CSS so I will be making those further changes going forward at least. 

I would also like to add to its responsiveness, including the addition of media queries.

***

### <ins>To doâ€¦:</ins>

[x] Change colour of text on submit button.

[x] Change colour of text in header and p.

[x] Shorten the CSS I can by combining selectors or utilising IDs.

[] Add responsiveness as I learn more about it.

[] Add interactivity with javascript to make the form fully functional.

[] Add font using ```@font-face```.

[x] Learn more about styling forms.

#### Update: 03/06/2023

Now going into my 4th week of web development bootcamp, I can see for myself the little mistakes I made here and there. 

I've also learned that having someone look over your code is worth its weight in gold.  When pointed out the mistakes seem so obvious you want to kick yourself or atleast I do ðŸ˜Š.

Web accessibility has become a passion of mine when it comes to web development, and this is what I was really aiming to fix on the form, I'm glad I was able to get a good Lighthouse report score for SEO, unfortunately it didn't recognise a certain oklab colour I used, so while CSS Overview in dev tools shows the issue fixed.
An error prevented me from getting a score for the accessibility.

After getting feedback from a friend who was originally in this field, I fixed the issues with the code readability.
He was also able to explain the quirk of the ```<textarea>``` I missed, where the closing tag is located in the html matters,
the white space between will be added to the ```<textarea>```.

I'm beyond happy to have finally taken the step to build something from scratch, show it to the world and to just keep applying what I learn to improve upon it ðŸ˜Š.
