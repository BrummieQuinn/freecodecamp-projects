# <ins>Freecodecamp project - survey form.</ins>

This was my first attempt at building a project, period.

## ***My thoughts.*** :thought_balloon:

### <ins>The structural layoutâ€¦</ins>

The HTML itself wasn't a problem, creating the form with the correct element tags wasn't too difficult.

However, I misunderstood the principle of semantic HTML to mean that no divs or spans could be used or at least sparingly if they were.

Obviously, this is not the case, as I came to realise upon styling the form.
Divs and spans can be added after the semantic HTML has been placed or during, to create containers around the elements to aid with targeted CSS styling of elements.

Most of my time was spent making sure the html was semantic.

### <ins>Stylingâ€¦</ins>

Caveat, CSS styling isn't my strong suit I feel.
So many choices, so little time ðŸ˜Š.

While given an example to give ideas, I decided I didn't want it to be completely exact in feel

I decided to focus on accessibility above all with my design choices as getting user information is the most important part of a form.

I chose subtle colours in a linear gradient to be easy on the eyes.

I also added a transition on the submit button, I thought it was kind of fun for the word submit to show up more clearly on hover.

On reflection, while fun, may not have been the best choice when I was focusing on accessibility.

### <ins>Final thoughtsâ€¦</ins>:thought_balloon:

I plan to keep going back to this web form to improve the CSS as I learn more.

For example,  I was given feedback on the button and the colour of the text in the header (accessibility) and I was also advised on how to neaten my html which I have already done and shorten my CSS so I will be making those further changes going forward at least. 

I would also like to add to its responsiveness, including the addition of media queries.
